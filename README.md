# random-movie-picker

### this was my first python project!
it is a simple program to grab a csv downloaded from Letterboxd and give you a random movie to watch and reduce the stress of movie-picking.

#### it includes:
- three versions of the same application
  - one of the versions is done exclusively with functions
  - two of the versions are made with classes
- the csv read and write functionalities were done with openpyxl
